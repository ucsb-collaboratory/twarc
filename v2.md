# What the New v2 API Can Give an Academic Researcher

Twitter has just released [Early Access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/early-access) to its new version of the API to academic researchers. Twitter’s v2 is cleaner and easier to use, with leaner JSONs allowing the user to manipulate the data to fit their needs. With a new developer portal and onboarding wizard, users can manage Apps and interact with the API to track usage and limits. Access to v2 includes “conversation threading, poll results in Tweets, pinned Tweets on profiles, spam filtering, and a more powerful stream filtering and search query language”<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>. Like v1.1, it supports streaming tweets in real time and tweets in the past. Unlike v1.1, v2 comes with the ability to collect data from the _full history_ of Tweets, dating back to Twitter’s first launch in 2006, and to do so at no cost <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>. This is perhaps the most important update to the API’s capabilities concerning academic research. 
 
While v2 is still in the development phase, Twitter is providing a [roadmap](https://trello.com/b/myf7rKwV/twitter-developer-platform-roadmap ), and continued use of v1.1. Eventually, they hope to replace v1.1 with v2,  at which point v1.1 will no longer be accessible. Getting involved from the beginning will allow academic researchers to provide feedback and ideas about the new API; and to familiarize themselves with an inevitable migration.
