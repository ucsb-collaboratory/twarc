Twarc is a Python tool that comes along with 47 small python utilities for harvesting and working with data from the Twitter public API.

It's important to note that there are limitations in the extent to which you can anylyze Twitter data using twarc. As such, many projects incorporate other tools of analysis such as with [MAXQDA](https://www.maxqda.com/blogpost/how-to-analyze-twitter-data). Twarc is just a stepping stool for analysis. What you decide to do with the data you've collected and cleaned is where analysis really takes place. Of course, twarc does offer several visualization tools but don't limited yourself to those tools. 

### Get twarc

The twarc readme is fairly comprehensive.  If you are comfortable running Python scripts, and have a usable installation with pip, you should be able to get up and running quickly. If not, you'll still be able to get it up and running, it just might take a little more time and effort. 

This guide concentrates on running the individual [twarc utilities](utilities.md).

### Twarc v2 

Twitter has just released an update of their [API](https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tools/2020/introducing_new_twitter_api.html). (More info found [here](https://news.docnow.io/twarc2-779278e66ea0) as well). Currently, it is only available as early access for academic research so if you're learning twarc for personal use or analysis, it won't be available. Luckily, this guide is for twarc v1.1. We hope to integrate the new API as it is developed, but we will keep the documentation on the older version.
