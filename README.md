## This is an experiment

We are practicing using github pages to produce helpful content for our communities to get work done.

Twarc is a Python tool that comes along with 47 small python utilities for harvesting and working with data from the Twitter public API.

### Get twarc

The twarc readme is fairly comprehensive.  If you are comfortable running Python scripts, and have a usable installation with pip, you should be able to get up and running quickly.

This guide concentrates on running the individual [twarc utilities](utilities.md).
