## This is an experiment

We are practicing using github pages to produce helpful content for our communities to get work done.

Twarc is a Python tool that comes along with 47 small python utilities for harvesting and working with data from the Twitter public API.

### Get twarc

The twarc readme is fairly comprehensive.  If you are comfortable running Python scripts, and have a usable installation with pip, you should be able to get up and running quickly.

This guide concentrates on running the individual [twarc utilities](utilities.md).

### Twarc v2 

Twitter has just released an update of their [API](https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tools/2020/introducing_new_twitter_api.html). (More info found [here](https://news.docnow.io/twarc2-779278e66ea0) as well). Currently, it is only available as early access for academic research so if you're learning twarc for personal use or analysis, it won't be available. Luckily, this guide is for twarc v1.1. We hope to integrate the new API as it is developed, but we will keep the documentation on the older version.
